## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS
- 7-1 SASS Architecture
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

This was a fairly difficult project to complete. I have learned a significant amount, but the most obvious points are:

- How to make modular SCSS files using the 7-1 architecture.
- Accessing form elements.
- Form validation, with custom styling and insertion of elements.
- Grid layout.

### Continued development

To further work on this project, I would like to store form input data into Local Storage.
